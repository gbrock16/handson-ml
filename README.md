# handson-ml

This is my version of Aurelien Geron's jupyter notebooks. I am working the examples as I go through the book. You can find Geron's repository with the same name by clicking on the following link: <https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml>

All code belongs to Aurelien Geron - unless noted otherwise in the jupyter notebook.
